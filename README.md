# Java101 - Learning Repository

This repository contains my notes and small projects during my Java learning journey.  
All exercises are written in **Java** using IntelliJ IDEA.

## 📂 Projects

- **Project1GradeAverage**  
  A simple Java program that takes 5 course grades (Math, Geography, Physics, Chemistry, Biology) from the user,  
  calculates the average (GPA), and prints whether the student passed or failed.

- - **Project2TaxCalculator**  
    A Java program that calculates the price including VAT (KDV) and the tax amount.
- If the amount is **0–1000 TL**, VAT rate is **18%**.
- If the amount is **greater than 1000 TL**, VAT rate is **8%**.

- **Project3TriangleAreaCalc**  
  A Java program that calculates the **perimeter** and **area** of a triangle using **Heron’s formula**.
    - User inputs three sides of the triangle.
    - The program computes the semi-perimeter `u = (a + b + c) / 2`.
    - Perimeter = `2 * u`
    - Area = `√(u * (u - a) * (u - b) * (u - c))`
